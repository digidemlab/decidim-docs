# ðŸš¦ Create an account

Most of Decidim's content is public but to be able to fully participate, it is necessary to register.

To create an account, click on the **Sign up** button.

![]({{ site.url }}/decidim-docs/uploads/registrera.png)

You will need to fill in

* a name
* a username
* an e-mail address
* a password

And potentially more information that we gather with your own consent to measure participation in a more precise way.

You must then tick a box to confirm that you have read the conditions of use and you can tick another one to receive newsletters from the platform.

Finally, you can click on the button **Sign up**!

Dans les secondes ou minutes qui suivent, you should receive an e-mail to confirm your account.

To log back in, you can use the **Sign in** button right next to **Sign up**.

Fantastic, you are now registered and logged in and can start using Decidim at its full potential!
